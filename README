This tool is intented mainly for improving the PDF reading experience on
e-book readers (e.g. Sony Reader, or Kindle). The screen of a reader is not
large enough to fit a page of a not-especially prepared PDF document. Zooming
often requres "reflowing" the document content. Such reflowing is destructive
for tables or any special formatting which especially makes reading of computer-
related books very unpleasant.

As an example, the following sequence of pdfpp commands removes the margins,
splits every page in two parts vertically, and rotates them, so that each half
page takes the whole screen of the reader and thus enlarges the view without reflowing.
